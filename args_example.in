# ###############################################################
# example of input arguments for the vmc executable
# ###############################################################
#
# arguments can be passed either in a file such than this one, for instance:
#
# mpirun -np 4 ./vmc args_example.in
#
# or enumerated with format
#
# mpirun -np 4 ./vmc -channel=trans -samples=10
#
# All arguments must not be provided as they have default value (look at vmc.cpp to find which)
# mixed format is possible:
#
# mpirun -np 4 ./vmc args_example.in -L=16 -therm=1000
#
# values coming after the argument filename will override previously defined values.

# channel can be:
# channel=groundstate (groundstate calc)
# channel=long (longitudinal excitation subspace calc)
# channel=trans (transverse excitation subspace calc)
channel=groundstate
# results in 10 samples of the quantities
samples=1
# each made of 10 saves (i.e. written on permamnent storage during calculation)
samples_saves=1
# each done after a stat of 1000 measurements.
samples_saves_stat=1000
# number of random walk steps between two measurements.
# A value of 0 makes defaults to L^2 (safe)

# lattice (square) size
L=8
# Some variational parameters
phi=0.1
neel=0.0
jastrow=0
# calculation prefix to avoid overwriting (keep negative for auto-incrementation)
prefix=-1
# output directory
dir=.
# excitation subspace momentum (relevant only for trans and long channels
qx=4
qy=0
# thermalization steps in units of L*L
therm=300
# boundary conditions

# jastrow factor selection
jas_onebodystag=1
jas_twobodystag=0
# select or not the measurement of the instantenuous spin-spin correlation function
# relevant only for groundstate channel.
# Expensive (makes L^6 complexity rather than L^4. Excited subspace calculations are always L^6)
meas_statspinstruct=1
# measure the Projected Heisenberg Matrix (for ground state this gives the variational energy)
meas_projheis=1
# measure the staggered magnetization
meas_stagmagn=1
# track the Monte Carlo weight evolution during the random walk. Useful for thermalization checks
track_overlap=0
# track the staggered magnetization during the random walk. Usefule for thermalization checking
track_stagmagn=0
# second neighbour exchange
Jr=0.0
# verbosity
verbose=1
# experimental: an energy  cutoff for the selection of the excitations.
